As a reminder, all contributors are expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mechazod/minmap/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs exclusively. We have documented our issue handling processes in the [Issues wiki](https://github.com/mechazod/minmap/issues).

## Contributing Code

Code-level contributions to Minmap generally come in the form of [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests). The process of proposing a change to Minmap can be summarized as follows:

1. Fork the Minmap repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes, either locally or on CI once you opened a pull request.
5. Push the changes to your fork.
6. Create a pull request to the Minmap repository.
7. Review and address comments on your pull request.
    1. A bot may comment with suggestions. Generally we ask you to resolve these first before a maintainer will review your code.
8. If you haven't already, please complete the [Contributor License Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) ("CLA").

If all goes well, your pull request will be merged. If it is not merged, maintainers will do their best to explain the reason why.
